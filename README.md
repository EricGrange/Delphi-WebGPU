# Delphi-WebGPU

Headers and utilities for using WebGPU from Delphi

WebGPU headers are maintained at https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers/

**The header is NOT STABLE yet, breaking changes can happen on a weekly basis!**

Precompliled Dawn builds can be found at https://github.com/mmozeiko/build-dawn
(one is included in the "dawn-x64" folder)

Note that while precompiled wgpu-native builds can be found at at https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native they are not compatible at the moment (different enum values in their webpgu.h)

Header converted with Chet (https://github.com/neslib/Chet)

WebGPU tutorials and docs at https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/index.html

A "Proof of Contept" FMX driver that relies on these headers can be found at https://github.com/EricGrange/FMXutils
