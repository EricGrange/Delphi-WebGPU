# Delphi-WebGPU

Headers and utilities for using WebGPU from Delphi

Precompliled Dawn builds can be found at https://github.com/mmozeiko/build-dawn
(one is included in the "dawn-x64" folder)

Note that while precompiled wgpu-native builds can be found at at https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native they are not compatible at the moment (different enum values in their webpgu.h)

Header converted with Chet (https://github.com/neslib/Chet)
